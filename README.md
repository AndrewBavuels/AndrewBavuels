# Welcome to Holidata 🚀

**Holidata** is my data-driven portfolio showcasing a variety of projects in Data Analysis and Data Science. Based in Madrid, I work remotely to turn data into actionable insights and innovative solutions. I am currently seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and make an impact in the data field.

## Current Projects 🛠️

- 💻 **I have completed** the first part of a project series focusing on **data visualization and predictions with Machine Learning**, specifically related to Car Fuel Consumption. This phase was more centered around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), providing a solid foundation for the subsequent prediction models.
- 🔄 **Currently, I am preparing to advance to the second part of this series**, which will involve **making predictions** based on the insights from the EDA. To enhance the quality of these predictions, I am dedicating time to reinforce my understanding of Machine Learning concepts, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Data Analysis and Data Science - Skills and Expertise:

- Data Analysis and Science: Proficient in Python for data manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and machine learning modeling.
- Data Visualization: Experienced with Tableau and Power BI, including advanced features like DAX for creating interactive dashboards.
