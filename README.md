## About me

I am a Data Professional with a background in Industrial Organization Engineering with over 10 years of experience as a Management Analyst in the service and technology sectors. I have worked on Data Science projects, utilizing Python, SQL, and advanced analytics techniques, that highlight my ability to provide valuable insights and data-driven solutions.

- üíª Right now, I am working on the first part of a project series about applying advanced analytics, involving **data visualization and predictions with Machine Learning,** regarding Car Fuel Consumption. The main objective of this project is to learn machine learning algorithms and the maths behind them.
- üì± Then I am recycling a project in which I developed KPI Dashboards and Reporting Systems, using Python, Pandas, and NLP tools, making them more robust.
- üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Currently growing my skillset in Machine Learning and Data Analytics.
